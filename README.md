For this coursework, I was tasked with developing software to simulate a series of investment strategies in Python. 
The file contains an algorithm to model stock prices using a one-dimensional stochastic differential equation, as well as algorithm to simulate a trading strategy to replicate a call option through both delta-hedging and gamma-hedging strategies.
